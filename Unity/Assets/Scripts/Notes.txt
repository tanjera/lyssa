NEXT TO DO: CHARACTER MODELS
two chsracter models, human and comouter, facing each other
first opponent can be tutorial wooden dummy
turn based, each turn computer hits human
human has weapon, each color mana associated with damage value
each stone broken adds to damage dealt per turn
but the mana board accumulation still remains its own mechanic where it costs mana to break non-dragging colors


MAKE
badges for each stone element


MANA BOARD
uses pretty badge stones
large stone is 10 mana
medium stone is 5 mana
small stone is 1 mana


make prototype easier to play

maybe add some fancy 3d objects?

make icons for current mana amount counters
add currency...
add board items (silver coin, magical weapons, etc)
start making beginning levels (enemies)

MANA LOGIC: EVENTS
make events trigger mana counting



implement game logic re: dragging stone color accumulates mana of that color but other stone colors cost points to drag stone through & destroy...
     
move CameraPlane somewhere better integrated...
