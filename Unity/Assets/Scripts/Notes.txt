** BUGS **
1) stones can be dragged outside the board when applied with lots of force; 
	probably d/t configjoint -> fixedjoint with stone dragging, fixedjoint
	may "rip" stone through the colliders...




** TO DO NEXT **

-> Load Prototypes with Resources.Load()... will need to make all meshes into Prefabs

1 -> MAKE TOOLTIPS FOLLOW MOUSE FOR MOUSEOVER... eliminates static text panels
2 -> replace blue with black
3 -> FIX EPIO vertex groups for mocap retargeting

... remember/learn how to switch scenes in-game...
1) programmatically create character GameObjects (pre-programmed in lookup tables, Instantiate() on run...)
	... will require creating Transforms for spawn points
	... will need to standardize origins on character meshes

2) include basic default animations in lookup table along with GameObjects...

3) **create UI for special powers & attacks!**
	... just create badge stones and place above Epio's head... no need for a full UI... click the badges to trigger
	-> badges can be simple stones with UV for badge images (diff & norm)
	-> create Matrix for badge stones...
	... can eventually have tooltips
4) create backend for the special powers as well... ... ...
	... mostly done, just need to run the actual delegate Action() and
		1) funnel skills through triggering function to standardize Console_Output()
		2) add modifiers to guide heal/damage values, enable some Random.Range functionality
		3) pass Action an int totalDamage instead of doing the damage within the Action itself?

7) add backend for character to wear equipment (top, pants, weapon, rings, etc)
8) create character selection UI with 3D preview

... fix vertex groups for epio (for mocap)
... animate wooden dummy more
... add sounds

... make 3d paper doll dressing room for equipment?




** CODE **




** AESTHETIC **





** GAME LOGIC **
1) turn based, each turn computer hits human, human hits computer
	each stone broken adds to damage dealt per turn (for example weapon is fire staff, does 3 dmg/1 red mana, 2 per yellow, 1 per white, etc)
	human able to use abilities based on mana accumulated (color based)
	but the mana board accumulation still remains its own mechanic where it costs mana to break non-dragging colors




** EVENTUALLY... **
- add currency...
- add board items (silver coin, magical weapons, etc)




** BACKSTORY **
STORY: Lyssa, spirit of rage and fury has become empowered (method/how?)
