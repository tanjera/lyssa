** BUGS **
1) stones can be dragged outside the board when applied with lots of force; 
	probably d/t configjoint -> fixedjoint with stone dragging, fixedjoint
	may "rip" stone through the colliders...




** TO DO NEXT **
1) create player gameobject origins (empty gameObject transforms), so that on Start(), manually Instantiate()
	the character's gameObject (Player 1 has Aska Instantiate() on Player_1__Location, etc)
	... this way the gameObject is dynamically coded based on lookup tables in Game.cs, so that animations, etc
	are already linked together in the code (no need for hard coding)

2) trigger animations based on game logic...

... animate aska
... make 3d paper doll dressing room for equipment?




** CODE **




** AESTHETIC **





** GAME LOGIC **
1) turn based, each turn computer hits human, human hits computer
	each stone broken adds to damage dealt per turn (for example weapon is fire staff, does 3 dmg/1 red mana, 2 per yellow, 1 per white, etc)
	human able to use abilities based on mana accumulated (color based)
	but the mana board accumulation still remains its own mechanic where it costs mana to break non-dragging colors




** EVENTUALLY... **
- add currency...
- add board items (silver coin, magical weapons, etc)




** BACKSTORY **
STORY: Lyssa, spirit of rage and fury has become empowered (method/how?)
