** BUGS **
1) stones can be dragged outside the board when applied with lots of force; 
	probably d/t configjoint -> fixedjoint with stone dragging, fixedjoint
	may "rip" stone through the colliders...




** TO DO NEXT **
1) have mana board show stones to represent mana amounts (also to represent health & xp)
	each square can hold 4 small stones; then can turn all 4 into 1 big stone to equal "5"
	... ditto for enemy health board.

2) implement game logic re: dragging stone color accumulates mana of that color but other stone colors cost points to drag stone through & destroy...
	then this game logic will show immediate results through mana board




** CODE **
- move CameraPlane somewhere better integrated...




** AESTHETIC **
1) rig Aska & Wooden Dummy for animation retargeting...
2) trigger animations based on game logic...




** GAME LOGIC **
1) turn based, each turn computer hits human, human hits computer
	each stone broken adds to damage dealt per turn (for example weapon is fire staff, does 3 dmg/1 red mana, 2 per yellow, 1 per white, etc)
	human able to use abilities based on mana accumulated (color based)
	but the mana board accumulation still remains its own mechanic where it costs mana to break non-dragging colors




** EVENTUALLY... **
- add currency...
- add board items (silver coin, magical weapons, etc)
