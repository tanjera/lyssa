** BUGS **
1) stones can be dragged outside the board when applied with lots of force; 
	probably d/t configjoint -> fixedjoint with stone dragging, fixedjoint
	may "rip" stone through the colliders...



** TO DO NEXT **


add particles to tile being dragged

... INTEGRATE OLD SIFR INTO LYSSA ...
	-> Integrate audio handler


*** TO MAKE PLAYABLE ***
4) get the stone logic -> HUD playable/usable




... major changes ... !!!!!
	-> have SIX energy colors, three diametrically opposed pairs
	-> collecting stones: you can only collect the 3 primary colors of your ship's energy grid



... bug solution!
	-> to fix Iterate_Down__Playing_Board(), iterate **from the top** and not from the bottom!!



... do more programmatically
	-> load Prototypes with Resources.Load()... will need to make all meshes into Prefabs
		programmatically create character GameObjects (pre-programmed in lookup tables, Instantiate() on run...)
		... will require creating Transforms for spawn points
		... will need to standardize origins on character meshes
		


... remember/learn how to switch scenes in-game...


... once playable ...
	-> add currency
	-> add a store for modules
