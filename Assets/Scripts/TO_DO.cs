     12/21, left over from:
     
     integrate the DragRigidbody script into Board_Item.cs better; naming conventions, put the functions in order, etc.
     *  then move CameraPlane somewhere better integrated...
     
     
     then it should almost be ready for some game logic (destroying collateral tiles while dragging one stone across the board costs X mana, etc)
     and/or fancy effects (on stone destroy, make it explode? instead of just disappearing...)
