    /* TO DO
     
     * make prototype easier to play
     * make board 8x8
     * 
     * maybe add some fancy 3d objects?
     * 
     * make icons for current mana amount counters
     * add currency...
     * add board items (silver coin, magical weapons, etc)
     * start making beginning levels (enemies)
     * 
     * OPTIMIZATION... and organization
     * ... use events to trigger mana pool additions instead of directly adding
     * and this can help game logic determine whether or not to add or subtract mana
     * 
     * 
     * 
     - implement game logic re: dragging stone color accumulates mana of that color but other stone colors cost points to drag stone through & destroy...
     
     - combine Player, Characters, and Skills.cs into one...
     - move CameraPlane somewhere better integrated...
     
     - add some 3D models... make it look pretty
     -- snowflakes, fire, etc
      
      
     
     * 
     * 
     
     color definitions...
     * 
        Blue- water
        Green- life/leaves
        Red- fire
        White- snow/ice
        Yellow- light
